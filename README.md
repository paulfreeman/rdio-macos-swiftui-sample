Rdio macOS SwiftUI example app for Big Sur

I love what Jordan did here, and its a great example of how little code volume is needed to create the layout for a Mac App with SwiftUI. 

I'll use this as part of my process of learning my way around the MacOS platform on my journey towards my first Mac App.
